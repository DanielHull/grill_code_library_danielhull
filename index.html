          <p>MATLAB provides many useful features both design and functionally that can make day to day operations both comfortable and productive. However, there remain many potentially useful features to run in correspondence with code to create additional improvements in productivity. What we did is used MATLAB itself to program this new functionality to improve project displays.</p>

<p>Essentially, we generated an output followup to every class that one runs with an additional customizable methods section that details the methods with their appropriate names, provides links, and an indication of whether the method is static or not (i.e. changes with each instance). The links provided include a direct pathway construction for in text editing to the function placement within its repository, a help link, and a reference link for the inputs and outputs of this function.</p>

<p>To demonstrate this functionality I've provided this link here.

<p>This additional display in the methods section near the bottom is the improved output provided. One can easily notice the links underscoring the individual method for a help feature, the period for a link to the functions inputs and outputs and finally the colon link, our major improvement, that is a link to in text editing. Additionally, one can notice the inclusion of the (s) feature. This provides an indication whether our individual methods are static or not and is inserted before the methods themselves.</p>

<p>This is a major improvement within MATLAB, and is automatically run as long as it remains in the pathway. The code is provided with the link on the sidebar. </p>

<p>-Happy Coding
