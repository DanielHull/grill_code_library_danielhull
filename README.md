grill_code_library_danielhull
================================

The purpose of this repository is to provide a location for my code and data collection files for 
the Grill laboratory at Duke University in a single repository. With this in mind, I can share my
files to other members of the lab, keep track of the evolution of my files, and utilize the resources
of the github community. 

This code will constantly be updating as I progress in my development online as a coder.
