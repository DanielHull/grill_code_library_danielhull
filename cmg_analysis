classdef cmg_analysis
    % Purpose: Go through our data and analyze pressure traces
    % This class is designed to analyze a cystometrogram data file in .mat file and produce
    % desired values that will be defined below. 
    % This will allow users 
    % This will also read all of the files and their comments
    % Likely going to look at Urination frequency
    % Max pressure 
    % Dynamic Compliance, bursting period duration, silent period duration
    % and/or urine expulsion. Will see how to define some of these from the data set. Reading through
    % a. Re-established micturition reflexes show differential activation patterns after lumbosacral ventral root avulsion injury and repair in rats
    % b. A new technique for dynamic analysis of bladder compliance.
    % c. External urethral sphincter activity in diabetic rats
